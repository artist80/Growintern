This repository contains Python projects that were assigned in the Python Internship by Growintern. These are complete projects. 
1st Project 
The first project is an app built in Python that will tell you the weather of any city using Python. You will simply enter the name of the city and it will show you the weather of that city you entered.

2nd Project
The second project is for shortening the URL. As well as you run the Python script, it will show you an address with a http://xxx.x.x.x:xxx from where you can get access to the URL Shortener App.
This is a simple URL Shortener that will simply shorten your URL. Try it and enjoy it. Some of the supported HTML templates are provided with the URL Shortener project. 
The process to run or complete this project is simple. First, create a directory and name it what you want. Then go to that created directory and create a file "app.py". Simply, copy the code from the "app.py" file from this directory.
Then in that created directory where "app.py", your newly created file is present, create another directory and name it "templates". Go to the "templates" directory from the "project" directory and create there two HTML files given in this directory named "index.html" and "shortened.html". Now, your template has become ready to run the URL Shortener app properly. Just run the app from the project directory using this command: ./app.py and copy the given address or simply open it and see the magic.
