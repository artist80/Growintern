This repository contains Python projects that were assigned in the Python Internship by Growintern. These are complete projects. 
1st Project 
The first project is an app built in Python that will tell you the weather of any city using Python. You will simply enter the name of the city and it will show you the weather of that city you entered.

2nd Project
The second project is for shortening the URL. As well as you run the Python script, it will show you an address with a http://xxx.x.x.x:xxx from where you can get access to the URL Shortener App.
This is a simple URL Shortener that will simply shorten your URL. Try it and enjoy it. Some of the supported HTML templates are provided with the URL Shortener project.
